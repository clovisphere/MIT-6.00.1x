# MIT-6.00.1x

These are my solutions to weekly psets of the [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) course - *6.00-1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python* on [edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9). One of my goal in 2017 is to get the (programming) **FOUNDATIONS** right, I believe this course is a good starting point.

######Note to *future-self*:
10 years from now, you'll smile while going through these solutions, and when you do, remember how far you've come -- **ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH THE RIGHT MINDSET**, never forget!
