# MIT-6.00.1x

These are my solutions to weekly psets of the [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) course - *6.00-1x: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python* on [edx](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9). One of my goal in 2017 is to get the (programming) **FOUNDATIONS** right, I believe this course is a good starting point.

######Note:
I am releasing the code on GitHub for the **future me**, who 10 years from now will smile while going through the different solutions. 

**ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WITH THE RIGHT MINDSET** -- don't forget:-)
